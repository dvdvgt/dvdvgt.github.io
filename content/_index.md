Hello there! My name is David Voigt and I currently working as researcher at the [University of Tübingen](https://se.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/team/voigt/).

I am interested in programming language theory and type theory, especially in effect handlers and normalisation.

I received my Bachelor's and Master's also at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/fachbereich/).
During my studies, I worked as a instructor and research assistant.
